# Motion Detector

This is a Python that is leveraging OpenCV to grab images from one of the cameras attached to the host and try to detect motion.<br>
The main goal for this app is to run on some small embedded devices like Raspbery PI or maybe even ESP32 and have them deployed all over the place to either alert when there is movement or to snap pictures and take video of migrating animals in my piece of the forest where I live.<br>

The app has a bunch of whistles and bells and is in POC / exploration state.  The doc will get updated when things are more concrete.<br>
